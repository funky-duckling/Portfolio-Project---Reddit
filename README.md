# Opposite Reddit App

Welcome to the **Opposite Reddit** app! This is a fun, experimental version of Reddit where everything you search for returns the opposite of what you typed. The project is built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Fake Local Data** (with plans to integrate the Reddit API in the future).

## Features

- **Custom-designed Reddit posts**: View posts with associated subreddits and images.
- **Opposite-Reddit functionality**: Search terms will return the opposite of what you typed in.
- **Responsive design**: The app is fully responsive, built with Tailwind CSS, and works across devices.
- **Sample data**: The app is preloaded with fake data for testing and demo purposes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.
- **PropTypes**: For type-checking props in React components.
- **Fake Data**: For testing the app before using the actual Reddit API.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
